# CryptoZap

CryptoZap is a minimalist macOS app for securely encrypting and decrypting files using Apple's CryptoKit and SwiftUI. Designed for simplicity and speed, with a modern drag-and-drop interface.

## Features

- Encrypt multiple files with a password
- Automatically ZIP files before encryption
- Drag-and-drop UI for easy file selection
- Custom `.encrypted` file format
- Decrypt with password and restore original files and folders
- Built entirely with native SwiftUI and CryptoKit

## Requirements

- macOS 12.0+
- Apple Silicon (M1, M2, etc.)

## Installation

Download the latest `.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/rodnoy/CryptoZap/releases) section.

### üîê Encryption Standard

CryptoZap uses AES-GCM encryption with a symmetric key derived via HKDF using SHA-256. This method is chosen for its balance of strong security and high performance. The salt ensures that the derived key is unique for every encryption.

### üß∞ Command-Line Interface (CLI)

In addition to the SwiftUI GUI app, CryptoZap provides a fully featured CLI tool: `cryptozap-cli`.

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cryptozap-cli
```

Examples:

```bash
cryptozap-cli encrypt ~/Secrets/file.txt -o ~/Desktop
cryptozap-cli encrypt ~/Documents/FolderToEncrypt --output ~/Desktop
cryptozap-cli decrypt ~/Desktop/EncryptedFile.encrypted
```

You can use short aliases for arguments:

- `--output` ‚Üí `-o`
- `--help`   ‚Üí `-h`

### üí° Developer Tools

For developers, CryptoZap includes an install script `install.sh` and a release helper `release.sh`. These scripts allow local installation and packaging of the CLI with man pages and autocompletion support for bash, zsh, and fish.

- Autocompletion and man pages are installed to proper system paths
- SHA256 is auto-calculated
- Archive is `.tar.gz`-ready for GitHub Releases
